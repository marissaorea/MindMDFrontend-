# Project Title

Mind M.D

## Objective

My motivation behind Mind M.D is to offer users a list of Psychiatrists that they can filter through by specific health insurance and their location. My main inspiration came from ZocDoc except I wanted a product targeted exclusively for users who are seeking pre-emptive mental health care.
